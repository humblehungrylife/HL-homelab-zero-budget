## 🔍 Verify Your Setup

After uploading, check these links work:

1. Main README: `https://github.com/humblehungrylife/HL-Zero-Budget-Lab`
2. Week 1 Guide: `https://github.com/humblehungrylife/HL-Zero-Budget-Lab/blob/main/Weekly_Progress/Week_1_Proxmox_Base/Week_1_Proxmox_Base.md`
3. Week 0 README: `https://github.com/humblehungrylife/HL-Zero-Budget-Lab/blob/main/Weekly_Progress/Week_0_Prep/README.md`

All should show placeholder content instead of 404 errors! ✅

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Read**: Open `STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
2. **Plan**: Use `CHECKLIST.md` to track your progress
3. **Start**: Begin with Week 0 documentation
4. **Replace**: Delete placeholder content, add your real content
5. **Commit**: Push changes regularly to GitHub

## 🎨 Customization Tips

### Keep Everything Working
- ✅ DO: Replace placeholder content
- ✅ DO: Add new files to directories
- ✅ DO: Keep existing filenames
- ❌ DON'T: Rename files (breaks links)
- ❌ DON'T: Change directory structure
- ❌ DON'T: Delete placeholder files before replacing them

### Adding New Content
```markdown
# Example: Adding an image to Week 1

1. Save image: Weekly_Progress/Week_1_Proxmox_Base/docs/screenshot.png
2. Reference in markdown: ![Proxmox Dashboard](docs/screenshot.png)
3. Commit both the image and the updated markdown file
```

## 🔒 Security Reminders

Your `.gitignore` is configured to exclude:
- Private keys and certificates
- Passwords and credentials
- Personal notes
- VM files
- Terraform state files

**Always review before committing sensitive configurations!**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Links still showing 404?
1. Verify file is uploaded to GitHub
2. Check filename exactly matches (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure file is in correct directory
4. Wait a few minutes for GitHub to process

### Can't see changes?
1. Clear browser cache
2. Force refresh: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
3. Try incognito/private browsing

### Files not uploading?
1. Check file sizes (GitHub has 100MB limit per file)
2. Verify you have push access to repository
3. Check for special characters in filenames
