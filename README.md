## 🧩 About the Project
The **HL Zero-Budget Lab** is designed to simulate a modern SOC + AI research environment entirely on personal hardware.  
Each phase documents the build process — from BIOS prep to GPU passthrough — while maintaining a **hybrid public/private model** for security and monetization.

## 🧠 Hybrid Repository Policy

| Branch | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| **`main`** | Public — documentation, sanitized configs, learning resources (MIT-licensed) |
| **`lab-private`** | Private — sensitive configs, logs, automation playbooks (proprietary/not for redistribution) |

> Certain configurations, datasets, and proprietary materials are **not** covered under the MIT License and remain confidential.
